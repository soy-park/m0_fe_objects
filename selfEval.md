# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    - I struggled with whether to use the log of Object.entries() or simply use console.log(object) to print the object. Also, it was difficult to not look at notes when writing code.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    - Note-taking can be better. I started taking notes in a small notebook and plan on transferring to a larger notebook. 
    - I'm finding it helpful to review lessons before class and then writing notes during class on things that I've missed or need to review more. That is when I find myself taking the most useful notes. 
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    - I noticed that when solving a problem, I lean into solving it on my own first, but spend more time Googling it afterwards.
